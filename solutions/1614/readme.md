# 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses ðŸŸ¢

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

 - It is an empty string ```""```, or a single character not equal to ```"("``` or ```")"```,
 - It can be written as ```AB``` (```A``` concatenated with ```B```), where ```A``` and ```B``` are **VPS**'s, or
 - It can be written as ```(A)```, where ```A``` is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth ```depth(S)``` of any VPS ```S``` as follows:

 - ```depth("") = 0```
 - ```depth(C) = 0```, where ```C``` is a string with a single character not equal to ```"("``` or ```")"```.
 - ```depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))```, where ```A``` and ```B``` are VPS's.
 - ```depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)```, where ```A``` is a VPS.

For example, ```""```, ```"()()"```, and ```"()(()())"``` are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ```")("``` and ```"(()"``` are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string ```s```, return the **nesting depth** of ```s```.

### Commentary

 - This is the single worst description I have ever seen in my life, and I can say with 100% confidence I will never find anything worse.
 
 - I cannot fathom how you could possibly write anything more unnecessarily convoluted and asinine than this.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int cur{ 0 };
        int most{ 0 };
        for(char& c : s)
        {
            if(c == '(')
                cur++;
            else if(c == ')')
                cur--;
            most = std::max(most, cur);
        }
        return most;
    }
};
```
