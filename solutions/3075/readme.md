# 3075. Maximize Happiness of Selected Children ðŸŸ¡

You are given an array `happiness` of length `n`, and a positive integer `k`.

There are `n` children standing in a queue, where the `ith` child has happiness value `happiness[i]`. You want to select `k` children from these `n` children in `k` turns.

In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that have not been selected till now decreases by `1`. Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and gets decremented only if it is positive.

Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by selecting `k` children.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumHappinessSum(vector<int>& happiness, int k) {
        std::sort(happiness.begin(), happiness.end(), std::greater<int>());
        long long total{ 0 };
        for(int i{ 0 }; i < k; i++)
            total += std::max(0, ((happiness.at(i) - i)));
        return total;
    }
};
```
