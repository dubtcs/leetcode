# 1598. Crawler Log Folder ðŸŸ¢

The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

The operations are described below:

 - `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
 - `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
 - `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
 
You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `ith` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.

### Explanation

This is basically a stack, but because the state of the stack doesn't matter at all, you can just use a depth counter variable and increment or decrement based on the given operations.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
        std::size_t depth{ 0 };
        for(std::string& s : logs)
        {
            if(s != "./")
            {
                if(s == "../")
                    depth -= (depth > 0);
                else
                    depth++;
            }
        }
        return depth;
    }
};
```
